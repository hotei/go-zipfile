Project go-zipfile.  

2010-04-27 Started project to convert public domain zipfile.py into go.  
	master branch only at this point

	We're going to use package 'main' while testing stuff, then move the working parts to package 'zipfile'

	The makefile will be generalized a bit later.  
	For now, using a very simple one which works on my system (AMD64).
