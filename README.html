<h1><center>Project go-zipfile.</center></h1>


<h3>2010-04-27 Started project to convert public domain zipfile.py into go.  <h3>
<pre>
	git master branch only at this point

	I'm going to use package 'main' while testing stuff, then move the working parts to package 'zipfile'

	The makefile will be generalized a bit later.  
	For now, using a very simple one which works on my system (AMD64).

	This conversion is based on the code from Python-2.6.5.tar.bz2 from www.python.org.  Specifically,
	Python-2.6.5/Lib/zipfile.py.

	The "zip" specification document can be found at http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT
	(URL valid as of April 2010)

	Goal for end result is to work like the package 'zlib' interface.

<h3>Steps along the way...</h3>
<ol>
<li> open the named zip file and validate that it is in fact a zip-encoded file
</ol>
