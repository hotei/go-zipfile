<h1><center>Project go-zipfile.</center></h1>


<h3>2010-04-27 Started project to convert public domain zipfile.py into go.  <h3><br><br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
Sending only git master branch to github at this point<p>

I'm going to use package 'main' while testing stuff, then move the working parts to package 'zipfile'<p>

The makefile will be generalized a bit later.  <p>
For now, using a very simple one which works on my system (AMD64).<p>

This project was inspired initially by the code from Python-2.6.5.tar.bz2 from www.python.org.  Specifically,
Python-2.6.5/Lib/zipfile.py. However, after converting a few hundred lines or so it became apparent that a
"rethink" of the project was in order.  The thought is 1) make it simple.  2) make it work  3) rinse and repeat.  
This seemed easier if I just started from scratch.  I know python fairly well and go not very much, so this
is a learning experience for me.  I don't profess the go code to be anywhere near optimal at this point, but
it should at least work if it made it to github. I've got lots of sections still marked "TODO" for error
handling, so please be wary if you intend to base a project of your own on this code.  While not required,
I'd like to know if you choose to do so.  Also, if find problems with the code I'd like to know about them.
<p>

The "zip" specification document can be found at http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT
(URL valid as of April 2010)<p>

Goal for end result (originally) was to work like the package 'zlib' interface.  
Now goal is evolving sideways a bit... <p>

The implementation provides filters that uncompress during reading and compress during writing. For example, to write compressed data to a buffer:<p>
<pre>
var b bytes.Buffer
w, err := ziplib.NewDeflater(&b)
w.Write([]byte("hello, world\n"))
w.Close()

and to read that data back:

r, err := ziplib.NewInflater(&b)
io.Copy(os.Stdout, r)
r.Close()
</pre>

<h3>Steps along the way...</h3>
<ol>
<li> (done) open the named zip file and validate that it is in fact a zip-encoded file
<li> (done) open a named zip file and return a list of all the files included in it ie. mylist := ListOfFiles("filename.zip")
<li> Next: extract (by name) an uncompressed file into a data[]byte object ie.  mydata, err := GetFile("src/Makefile")
</ol>
