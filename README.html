<h1><center>Project go-zipfile.</center></h1>


<h3>2010-04-27 Started project to convert public domain zipfile.py into go.  <h3>
<pre>
	git master branch only at this point

	I'm going to use package 'main' while testing stuff, then move the working parts to package 'zipfile'

	The makefile will be generalized a bit later.  
	For now, using a very simple one which works on my system (AMD64).

	This conversion is based on the code from Python-2.6.5.tar.bz2 from www.python.org.  Specifically,
	Python-2.6.5/Lib/zipfile.py.

	The "zip" specification document can be found at http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT
	(URL valid as of April 2010)

	Goal for end result is to work like the package 'zlib' interface.

The implementation provides filters that uncompress during reading and compress during writing. For example, to write compressed data to a buffer:

var b bytes.Buffer
w, err := ziplib.NewDeflater(&b)
w.Write([]byte("hello, world\n"))
w.Close()

and to read that data back:

r, err := ziplib.NewInflater(&b)
io.Copy(os.Stdout, r)
r.Close()

</pre>
<h3>Steps along the way...</h3>
<ol>
<li> (done)open the named zip file and validate that it is in fact a zip-encoded file
<li> python's struct module is imported and used 22 times  may need to look at implementing that in go?
</ol>
